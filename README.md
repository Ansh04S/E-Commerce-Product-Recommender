# E-Commerce-Product-Recommender

**Project title**
E-commerce Product Recommender with LLM Explanations

**Objective**
Build a recommender that combines standard recommendation logic (collaborative/content-based) with human-friendly LLM-generated explanations: for each recommended product, present “Why this product?” in plain language grounded on the user’s behavior and product metadata.


**Scope**
Inputs:
•	Product catalog (id, title, description, category, metadata)
•	User behavior logs (views, clicks, add-to-cart, purchases — implicit/explicit signals)
Outputs:
•	For a user: ranked product recommendations
•	For each recommendation: an LLM-generated explanation (explain why the product fits the user)
Optional:
•	Simple frontend dashboard to show recommendations and explanations.

**Architecture (high-level)**
1.	Data storage: relational DB or NoSQL (e.g., PostgreSQL/SQLite for demo) with tables: products, users, interactions.
2.	Offline pipeline:
o	Preprocess metadata (tokenize descriptions, compute TF-IDF).
o	Build user-item interaction matrix (implicit weights).
o	Train recommenders: (a) collaborative SVD / ALS, (b) content-based (TF-IDF + cosine), optionally hybrid ranker that combines scores.
3.	Model serving:
o	Backend API (FastAPI) that serves /recommend/{user_id} and /explain/ endpoints.
4.	LLM integration:
o	Compose a prompt that includes: product metadata, user recent interactions, and the model’s score/rationale.
o	Send to an LLM (OpenAI/GPT or other) to generate a natural explanation.
o	Cache or pre-generate explanations for top N items in production to reduce latency.
5.	Frontend (optional):
o	Simple UI showing recommended products with explanation. Highlight signals (e.g., "you bought similar item X", "popular in your city", etc.).

**Algorithms & choices (demo)**
•	Collaborative: Truncated SVD (fast and easy to reproduce) on a user-item matrix. Produces user & item latent factors — fast for a demo and sufficiently illustrative.
•	Content-based: TF-IDF vectors on product descriptions and cosine similarity.
•	Hybrid: Weighted sum of normalized collaborative and content scores (if desired).
•	Explainability: Use an LLM to convert model signals into human text. Prompt template:
"Explain why product {title} (category: {category}) is recommended to user {user_id} given the user's recent items {history} and the product metadata: {metadata}. Refer to model signals like category similarity, feature overlap, and interaction strength."


**Evaluation**
•	Offline metrics: Precision@K, Recall@K, NDCG@K using holdout interactions.
•	Online evaluation: A/B test with click-through or add-to-cart lift.
•	Qualitative: human evaluation of explanation quality (coherence, correctness, usefulness).


Ethical and practical considerations
•	Avoid exposing private user data in explanations.
•	Don't fabricate facts: use product metadata and interaction signals only — if using an LLM, constrain prompts to avoid hallucination and add a verification step.
•	Rate-limit LLM calls and cache repeated prompts.
